Description: Solve a system of nonlinear equations using a Broyden or a Newton method
             with a choice of global strategies such as line search and trust region.
             There are options for using a numerical or user supplied Jacobian,
             for specifying a banded numerical Jacobian and for allowing
             a singular or ill-conditioned Jacobian.
