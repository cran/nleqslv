1.7

o negative values for stepmax (maximum stepsize) now imply no maximum stepsize.
  The default for stepmax (maximum stepsize) -1.0 so there is no maximum stepsize.
  
o removed the Levenberg-Marquardt correction for ill-conditioned or singular jacobians.
  The correction hardly ever gave sensible results. The algorithm now returns
  an error condition when a Jacobian is singular or ill-conditioned.
  
1.6.1

o fixed several incomplete last lines

1.6

o corrected initialization bug
o corrected parameter error for Cauchy start in examples
o code cleaning to get rid of fortran statement labels

1.5

o corrected missing/superfluous closing brackets in nleqlsv.Rd

1.4

o correct horrible bug caused by typo in nwnwtn causing dgeqrf to be called 
  with an absurd value for the lwork argument. Typical fortran problem.

1.3

o use blocked Lapack QR routines.
  Significant speed increase for larger n (500+) in most cases.

1.2

o corrected wrong name for the flag for checking an analytical jacobian in  nleqslv.R
  and the documentation

1.1

o the default initial trust region size is now set to the length of the Newton step

o corrected various errors in the documentation
	* the termination codes were a muddle
	* several elements of the return list were incorrectly named in the documentation

1.0

o initial version
